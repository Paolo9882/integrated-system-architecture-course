.SH DESCRIPTION
.B inn.sh
This script is able to automate the place & route with Cadence Innovus (the commands' flow is in the \fBinn.tcl\fR script). After that, it can simulate the netlist generated by the place & route phase and perform switching activity-based power estimation invoking Modelsim and Innovus.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-b
Option to perform the backannotation process only. It requires an existing layout.
In that case a simulation of the generated netlist will be done and the results
will be checked against the model.

.TP
.BR \-c
Option to perform the entire backannotation process. Also the first part of the place & route is performed.
In that case a simulation of the generated netlist will be done and the results
will be checked against the model.

.TP
.BR \-p " " \fI <CLOCK_PERIOD_IN_NANOSECONDS> \fR
Option to specify the clock period (in nanoseconds) that will be used during the backannotation phase.
The default value is already specified in this script and that will be used by default.
