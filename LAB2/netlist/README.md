## Folder organisation

This folder contains one single Verilog netlist (.v file) that is automatically generated by Synopsys Design Compiler every time a version of the multiplier is synthesized. Why is this useful? The Verilog netlist is then simulated using ModelSim with the testbench to verify that the synthesized circuit works correctly.
