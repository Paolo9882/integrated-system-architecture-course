.SH NAME
syn.sh \- Automate digital synthesis' workflow.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./syn.sh
\fB\-v\fR \fISYNTHESIS_NAME\fR
.IR [OPTIONS]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B syn.sh
This script is able to automate the synthesis with Synopsys Design Compiler (the commands' flow is in the \fBsyn.tcl\fR script). After that, it can simulate the netlist generated by the synthesis phase and perform switching activity-based power estimation invoking Modelsim and Synopsys Design Compiler.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-v " " \fI <SYNTHESIS_VERSION> \fR 
This is \fI mandatory \fR. It expects a name that will be appended on all the generated reports' filenames.
 e.g. syn.sh -v firstversion -> area_report_firstversion.txt, timing_report_firstversion.txt, ... will be generated in the syn/reports folder.

.TP
.BR \-e " " \fI <TOP_ENTITY_NAME> \fR
Specify the top-entity name (that must be also equal to the top-entity description file).
This information is needed by Synopsys to retrieve the correct description file and to generate all the files (*.v, *.sdf, *.sdc, ...) with that same name.

.TP
.BR \-p " " \fI <CLOCK_PERIOD_IN_NANOSECONDS> \fR
pecify the clock period (in nanoseconds) that will be used during the synthesis phase.
The default value is already specified in this script and that will be used by default.

.TP
.BR \-c
[!] \fI ATTENTION \fR [!]
This specifies to clean previous logs and ALL previously generated reports
