## Folder Organisation

This directory contains the following directories:

- common: common files for the various designs

- fpmul_pipeline: VHDL files of the original design of the FP Multiplier

- fpmul_pipeline_inregs: VHDL files of the FP Multiplier with input (interface) registers

- fpmul_pipeline_finegrain: VHDL files of the FP Multiplier with input registers and
  one pipeline level in the second stage (fpmul_stage2_struct.vhd)

- fpmul_mbe: VHDL files of the FP Multiplier with input registers, one pipeline level in the second stage and a significand multiplier based on the MBE algorithm. The structure of the MBE multiplier and of the Dadda Tree-based CSA are automatically generated by a Python script inside the folder fpmul_mbe/dadda_tree_generator

- fpmul_mbe_fastadder: same as before, but the last stage is not a RCA but a behavioral adder that is implemented as a pparch adder during synthesis
